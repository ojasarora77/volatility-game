# üß® VolatilityLottery

A decentralized lottery that triggers rounds based on real-time price volatility, built natively on **Flare's enshrined protocols**.

---

## üöÄ Overview

**VolatilityLottery** is a fully on-chain lottery system where:
- Users pay an **entry fee** to participate.
- A new round starts when triggered by price volatility exceeding a threshold.
- Winners are selected **fairly and randomly** using Flare‚Äôs secure randomness provider.

The system autonomously:
- Fetches **finalized price data** using **Flare FTSO (Flare Time Series Oracle)**.
- Ensures verified data integrity using the **Flare Finalization Data Connector (FDC)**.
- Picks winners using **Flare‚Äôs native Random Number Generator (RNG)** for unbiased randomness.

## üì° Why Flare?

This project fully embraces Flare's enshrined protocols:
- **FTSO**: To retrieve real-time, finality-assured asset price feeds and detect significant market volatility.
- **FDC (Finalization Data Connector)**: To verify that the price data is finalized and trusted before triggering a round.
- **Flare Random Number Generator**: To select the lottery winner in a verifiably fair manner, free from miner or user manipulation.

By combining these protocols, **VolatilityLottery** ensures that the dApp is **trustless**, **autonomous**, and **provably fair**, showcasing the power of building on Flare.
